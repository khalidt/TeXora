# Checks the packages of one version for any video decoder, ffmpeg, VLC or codec library, and stops if
# one is found. TeXora ships none of these: MP4 playback uses VLC or ffmpeg installed on the computer.
# Two checks: no such file in any package, and no such code built into any file (a decoder compiled
# into the program leaves its name inside it, as OpenH264 did). Sample videos inside the program are
# files, not decoders, so the name x264 writes into every video it makes is not searched for.
# Pictures in royalty-free formats (WebP, AVIF/AV1, JPEG XL, GIF, TIFF, BMP) are decoded inside
# TeXora on purpose; HEIC/HEIF uses HEVC, which is patented, so libheif and libde265 must never be in.
# Usage: scripts/check-no-codecs.sh dist/<version>
