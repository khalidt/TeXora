# Changelog

All notable changes to TeXora. The newest version is first. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where MINOR adds features that keep existing documents working and PATCH only fixes.

## 1.6.1

### Fixed

- **The 1.6.0 packages could not be made.** From Rust 1.100, Cargo keeps a build script's files one folder deeper, so the PDF engine (PDFium) was copied into `target/release/build/` instead of beside the program, and every package step stopped with "libpdfium: No such file". The build now finds the program's folder by name, works with Rust 1.99 and 1.100, and stops with a clear message if the engine cannot be put there. Nothing else changed from 1.6.0, which was tagged but never released.

## 1.6.0

### New

- **AVIF, WebP, JPEG XL, GIF, TIFF, BMP and HEIC/HEIF pictures.** Write `\usepackage{texoraimage}` and `\includeimage[width=0.5\linewidth]{photo.avif}`; the options are those of `\includegraphics`. pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX cannot read these formats, so before LaTeX runs TeXora converts each one to an ordinary JPEG (PNG when it has transparency, which is kept) in a `texora-images` folder beside the presentation, and LaTeX includes that copy. A copy is made again only when its picture changes. PNG, JPEG, PDF and EPS pictures go straight to `\includegraphics`, so `\includeimage` works for any picture.
- **Works in other LaTeX editors.** TeXora puts `texoraimage.sty` beside the presentation. With it and the `texora-images` folder, the document compiles in any LaTeX editor (tested with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX) and shows every picture. Without the folder it still compiles, with a framed box naming each picture instead of an error.

### Fixed

- **Videos in other LaTeX editors.** A presentation using `\usepackage{texoravideo}` stopped with "File `texoravideo.sty' not found" in other editors, because the package lived only inside TeXora. TeXora now puts `texoravideo.sty` beside the presentation too (keeping it up to date, and leaving alone any file of that name that is not TeXora's). With the `texora-video` folder every video shows its poster; a video without a poster yet is a dark box with a play sign and its name, drawn by LaTeX, instead of a missing-file error. See "Using another LaTeX editor" in the README.
- **Built-in decoders for royalty-free formats, in pure Rust.** WebP, GIF, TIFF and BMP are decoded by the `image` crate, JPEG XL by `jxl-oxide`, and AVIF by `avif-decode` with `rav1d` (the memory-safe Rust port of the dav1d AV1 decoder, built without its assembly). Nothing needs to be installed for these.
- **HEIC/HEIF stays outside TeXora.** HEIC pictures use HEVC, which is covered by active patents (like H.264), so TeXora contains no decoder for it and uses one already on the computer: `heif-dec` (libheif), macOS's built-in `sips`, ImageMagick, or the ffmpeg set in Settings > Video. These also stand in if a built-in decoder cannot read an unusual file. The release check now also stops any HEVC decoder (libheif, libde265) from entering a package.
- Missing pictures, files that are not really that format, unsupported formats and paths outside the presentation's folder are listed as warnings under Problems, with the line; the slides still build.

## 1.5.3

### Fixed

- **Custom Beamer classes.** Frames written as `\frame{…}` or with a frame environment of their own (defined in the file, or in a class or theme file beside it) now get their notes, titles, folding and slide-to-source links. Before, only `\begin{frame}` was read, so such a deck could show a note on the wrong slide.
- **`\againframe`** is understood: the repeated slide shows the note of the frame it repeats, and a note written on it goes into that frame. Before, every note after an `\againframe` moved one slide, and a note written there could go into the next frame.
- When the source's frames cannot be matched to the slides one for one (frames in separate files or made by a macro), notes from the source are not used and edited notes go into the `.note.md` file, so no note lands on the wrong slide. The notes panel says why.
- The top row says "notes found" for notes written as `\note{}` in the source too.

### Changed

- The README shows one animated tour of TeXora instead of separate screenshots, a short demo of a video, a GIF and `animate` animations playing inside slides, and explains custom classes and themes.

## 1.5.2

### New

- **Code folding in the LaTeX studio.** An arrow beside the line numbers folds a block to its first line: an environment (`\begin{…}` to `\end{…}`), a section up to the next heading of its level, the preamble, or a `{…}` group over several lines such as a long `\note`. A folded block shows how many lines it holds; click the arrow or that label to open it. Moving the cursor or jumping to a line inside a folded block opens it. Folding only changes the view; the file keeps every line.
- **Block guide.** A green bar beside the line numbers marks the block the cursor is in, and its first and last lines are highlighted, so the matching `\begin` and `\end` are easy to see.

### Changed

- **The version is shown** at the right end of the top row (for example `v1.5.2`; a click opens About) and in the window title.
- **Errors and warnings are told apart.** The Problems tab says "Problems: 8 warnings" or "Problems: 1 error, 8 warnings", and lists errors first, then warnings, each under its own heading and with an Error or Warning label. Warnings do not stop the build; errors do. A successful build says "no errors, 8 warnings", and lines with a warning have orange numbers in the editor (errors red).

## 1.5.1

### Fixed

- **Editing in LaTeX Studio.** After a click on Save, Compile, a checkbox or the slide, the editor lost the keyboard, so the next letters ran presenter shortcuts instead of typing: **B** blacked out the slide and the arrows changed slides and moved the cursor. The keyboard now stays with the editor; another text box (such as Search) still gets its own typing.
- **No more rebuilding as you type.** The **Live** box is gone: typing never saves or rebuilds by itself. Press **Compile** (Cmd/Ctrl+B), or **Save** (Cmd/Ctrl+S) with **Rebuild on save** on.
- A file opened from a terminal with a short path (`texora talk.tex`) now compiles and checks its packages; before, both failed with "No such file or directory".
- Videos play with their sound. The sound comes from ffplay, which is part of every ffmpeg install (TeXora finds it beside your ffmpeg), and follows the picture: it starts, pauses and starts again from the same place, starts again with a `loop` clip, and stops when you show another slide. TeXora still contains no decoder of its own.
- **Settings > Video > Play sound** turns video sound on or off (on by default), and the `mute` option of `\includevideo` now keeps one clip silent. GIFs have no sound.
- ffplay runs with the same safety as ffmpeg: no window, no shell, local files only and real video formats only.
- The Video Guide template's sample video has a soft chord, so you can hear sound working.
- **Sound with VLC only.** Without ffmpeg, a clip opened in VLC plays its sound in VLC (ffplay is not needed). The `mute` option and **Settings > Video > Play sound** off now also keep VLC silent, and Settings > Video says where the sound plays.
- **Picture and sound in sync.** The picture now follows the sound's own clock (ffplay reports it), so it waits the moment ffplay takes to start instead of running ahead. Measured with a clip that flashes and beeps each second: the picture was 730 ms ahead of the sound, now within about 5 ms, also after pause and play. After a pause the sound starts again exactly where the picture is (before, it could start seconds early, from the last key frame).

## 1.5.0

### Security

- ffmpeg opens a clip with `-nostdin -protocol_whitelist file` and a list of real video formats only, so a file that is really a playlist or a concat list cannot make ffmpeg read other files or web addresses. Tested with such files: plain ffmpeg follows them, TeXora's ffmpeg refuses them.
- VLC gets the clip's full path after `--`, so a file name starting with `-` is never read as an option, and only files that really are videos (from their first bytes, not their name): never a playlist.
- Which player runs, and where it is, comes only from your own Settings. A presentation, its `.tex` file, a PDF or anything in its folder can never set the program or add arguments; this is tested.

### New

- Videos and GIFs in your slides: `\usepackage{texoravideo}` and `\includevideo[width=0.5\textwidth]{clip.mp4}`. TeXora ships the LaTeX package and finds it by itself when it compiles. A second optional argument takes `autoplay`, `loop`, `posterat=<percent>` and `poster=<image>`.
- **GIFs play by themselves.** **MP4 playback uses VLC or ffmpeg installed on your computer**: with ffmpeg the clip plays inside the slide, with VLC in VLC's own window. TeXora contains no video decoder and never downloads or installs one.
- Settings > Video chooses the player (Auto, ffmpeg, VLC or Off), with a path and a **Test** button for each.
- A video that needs a player when none is installed says "This video needs VLC or ffmpeg installed on your computer.", with **Get VLC**, **Get ffmpeg** and **Copy install command**. TeXora only opens the pages and copies the command; it never runs it.
- Before compiling, TeXora makes each clip's poster in a `texora-video` folder (again only when the clip changes; a video's poster needs ffmpeg), so every PDF viewer shows the poster; a click in TeXora plays or pauses the clip, and another slide stops it and its ffmpeg.
- A missing file, a file that is not a video or a path outside the presentation's folder shows a message over the poster and under Problems.
- A video can be in the `.tex` file's folder or in any folder inside it; a video in a folder is written with the folder name, as in `\includevideo{videos/clip.mp4}`. "Video not found" says this in plain words.
- One poster per video, however often it is used; posters no longer used are removed.
- A new template, **Video Guide**, explains `\includevideo` slide by slide: what you need, a video, a looping GIF, every option, posters, overlays and what to do when a clip does not play. Its sample video and GIF are saved in a `media` folder beside the new file.

### Fixed

- Check packages finds packages, classes, themes and TikZ libraries of your own that sit beside the `.tex` file (or in a folder you name, as in `\usepackage{styles/house}`), as LaTeX does, and no longer reports them as missing or suggests `tlmgr install` for them (#3).
- The control bar under an animation (first, previous, play/pause, next, last) works again: its buttons now get the click, instead of the slide underneath taking it.

## 1.4.1

### Fixed

- In the LaTeX studio, the slide and notes preview keeps the width you drag it to, instead of jumping back when you let go.
- The black line at the right edge of the notes page is gone, in the presenter screen and the LaTeX studio; a faint frame shows the page's edge instead.
- The presenter screen no longer leaves an empty grey strip beside the notes page: the Notes column fits the page, and the slides take the rest.
- In the LaTeX studio, a header wider than the preview no longer pushes the slide past the window's edge.

### Improved

- Double-click the edge between the source and the preview to split them half and half again.
- The LaTeX studio's preview grows with its width: on a wide panel the notes move beside the slide, so the slide can use the full height.
- The notes page in the studio gets a box of its own shape, so it fills it with no empty margin.
- In the presenter screen, widening the slide column makes the current slide bigger; in the large slide view, the notes page and the next slide share their column at the same width.

### New

- **Wrap text** in the LaTeX studio wraps long lines at the editor's width; line numbers still count real lines.

## 1.4.0

### Improved

- A new look for the presenter screen, with the slide, notes and next slide on cards.
- A top row shows the open files, whether you are ready to present, and a **Present** button.
- The drawing tools sit beside the slide in the large slide view.
- The timer, then previous and next buttons with the slide number and overlay step, sit under the main panel.
- The talk's sections are shown as a coloured line with your place and your bookmarks; click one to go there.
- The time of day sits in the top row, beside **Present**; the pace shows under the sections.
- A note saved with Edit Note shows at once, without waiting for LaTeX to rebuild the slides.
- For a `.tex` presentation, **Also save in the .tex file** chooses whether notes go into the source as `\note{...}` or into the `.note.md` file.

### New

- When you fall behind, a button offers to skip slides to catch up.
- **New LaTeX presentation** on Home and in the File menu: choose one of eight templates.
- Three animated templates: Motion Lab, Flipbook and Media Studio, with animations, GIF frames and a video clip.
- The sample lecture opens with a 20-minute duration, a bookmark and example points in its notes.

## 1.3.0

### New

- Comment out or uncomment lines in the LaTeX studio with **Cmd/Ctrl+/**.
- With several lines selected, all of them are commented or uncommented at once.
- **Cmd/Ctrl+]** comments and **Cmd/Ctrl+[** uncomments; all three keys can be changed in Settings.
- Animations made with the LaTeX `animate` package now play, as in Adobe Acrobat.
- Animations start by themselves when set to (`autoplay`), loop or play back and forth, at their own frame rate.
- Click an animation to play or pause it; the presenter view has first, previous, play/pause, next and last frame buttons.
- Video clips (`\movie` or media9) show a play button and open in your video player; clips set to start by themselves do so during the talk.

## 1.2.0

### New

- Added LaTeX studio.
- Edit the `.tex` source beside a live preview of the slide and its notes.
- Slides rebuild shortly after you stop typing, or when you save.
- Problems with their line numbers, required packages and the full log in one panel.
- Double-click a slide to jump to its source; the slide follows the cursor as you move through the source.
- Open it with the studio button, **View > LaTeX studio** or **Cmd/Ctrl+E**; save with **Cmd/Ctrl+S**.
- **Check packages** opens the package list in the studio.

### Fixed

- Notes now stay the same in the presenter and the LaTeX studio.
- For a `.tex` presentation, a note edited in the presenter is saved into that slide's `\note{...}` in the source.
- A `\note` edited in the studio shows in the presenter, even when a `.note.md` file already exists.
- After a rebuild, the presenter stays on the slide you were on.
- A note being edited stays with its own presentation when you switch tabs.

## 1.1.0

### New

- Added Edit Note feature.
- Edit the notes of any slide in the notes panel: press **E** or click the edit button.
- Save with the tick button or **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter**; cancel with the cross or **Esc**.
- Notes file is saved in the same folder as the opened presentation, using the presentation's filename followed by `.note.md`.
- **Write notes** button on slides that have no notes yet.
- Notes can be written in any language: Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and more.
- Arabic notes read right to left, with words, numbers and punctuation in the right order.
- Typing Arabic in the note editor runs from the right edge, with words in reading order.
- Emoji show in colour.

### Fixed

- Text in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and emoji no longer shows as empty boxes.
- Notes files saved as UTF-16 (for example by Windows Notepad) or in older encodings now open correctly.

## 1.0.1

### New

- Update notice appears by itself when a new version is out.
- The notice offers **See what's new**, **Later** and **Skip this version**.
- The update box offers the download for your computer.
- TeXora checks for updates at start and every few hours while open.

### Fixed

- The bin button in **Recent files** now removes the file at once, without flickering.

### Changed

- **New LaTeX presentation** on Home is switched off.

## 1.0.0

- First public release.
- Presenter and audience views, LaTeX Beamer compiling and speaker notes.
- Drawing tools, laser pointer, zoom, bookmarks, contents, search and analytics.
- Installers for macOS, Windows and Linux.
